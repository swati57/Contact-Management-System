# Contact-Management-System

The Contact Management System is one of my personal project written in C++ language using file management.

# Some key-points

1. In this project, the contact of a person (name and contact number) can be added to a file permanently.
2. The users can modify, delete, and create contacts and display them through the console.
3. The saved contacts can also be searched from the file and basic operations can be performed in the console.
